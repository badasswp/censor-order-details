## Why Censor Order Details?

This plugin helps you hide sensitive custom data found in the WooCommerce Admin orders page from prying eyes. __Please note__ that it only visually hides the Order details information via custom CSS styling and does not tamper with the PHP code functionality of the page, the order details can still be accessed programatically via the page code.
